To make it easier to display your custom text, you can add an alias in your `~/.bashrc` file.

1. Open your `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
    

2. Add the following alias at the bottom of the file ading your name or any text :

    ```bash
    figlet -f slant -c "Your beautiful name " |lolcat
    ```

3. Save and exit the file by pressing `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter`.

4. Reload the `~/.bashrc` file (**just close all terminal** ) to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
